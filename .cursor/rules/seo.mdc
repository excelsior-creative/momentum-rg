# SEO & Sitemap Optimization Standards

Follow these rules to ensure maximum search engine visibility and accessibility.

## 1. Page Metadata
- Use `generatePageMetadata` for static pages and `generateArticleMetadata` for blog posts.
- **Title Tag**: Keep between 50-60 characters. Include primary keywords early.
- **Meta Description**: Keep between 150-160 characters. Use a clear call-to-action.
- **Canonical URLs**: Always ensure every page has a canonical URL pointing to the preferred version of the page.
- **Open Graph (OG)**: Ensure every page has an OG image (1200x630) and proper tags for social sharing.

## 2. Structured Data (JSON-LD)
- Always include `Organization` and `WebSite` schemas on every page (handled in root layout).
- Use `generateArticleSchema` for all blog posts.
- Use `generateBreadcrumbSchema` for deep hierarchies.
- Ensure all schemas use the `SITE_URL` from `lib/metadata.ts`.

## 3. Automatic Sitemap
- Maintain `src/app/sitemap.ts` to include all public-facing pages.
- Dynamic collections (like `Articles`) must be fetched and mapped to sitemap entries.
- Set appropriate `changeFrequency` and `priority` based on page importance.

## 4. Content Structure
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Use exactly one `<h1>` per page. Follow with logical `<h2>`, `<h3>` nested structure.
- **Image Alt Text**: Every `next/image` must have a descriptive, keyword-rich `alt` attribute.
- **Internal Linking**: Link to other relevant pages within the content using descriptive anchor text.

## 5. Local SEO
- Include location-specific keywords (e.g., "Orange County") naturally in content and metadata where relevant.
- Use `formatKeywordWithLocation` helper for AI-generated content targeting.
