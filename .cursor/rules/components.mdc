# Base UI Components (shadcn/ui)

These are the fundamental building blocks of the application. They are designed to be accessible, unstyled, and highly customizable.

## 1. Installation

Always use the CLI to install new base components:
`npx shadcn@latest add [component-name] --cwd ./apps/app`

## 2. Usage Standards

- **Imports**: Always import from `@/components/ui/[component]`.
- **Customization**: Use the `cn()` utility for merging custom classes with the default ones.
- **Controlled vs Uncontrolled**: Favor controlled components for complex forms.

## 3. Core Components Reference

- **Buttons**: Use for all triggers. Supports `variant` (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link).
- **Inputs/Labels**: Use for all form fields. Combine with `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation.
- **Dialogs/Sheets**: Use for modals and side-drawers. Aceternity's `animated-modal` often wraps these.
- **Cards**: Use for grouping content. Aceternity provides many specialized card variants (e.g., `3d-card`, `glare-card`) that should be used for marketing pages.

## 4. Integration with Aceternity

When a Pro template requires a base component (e.g., a Login form requiring a Button and Input):
1.  Check if the component is already in `apps/app/src/components/ui/`.
2.  If not, run the `shadcn add` command.
3.  Combine the base component's functionality with Aceternity's animations.

## 5. Accessibility (A11y)

- All components are built on top of Radix UI primitives and are accessible by default.
- Do not remove ARIA attributes.
- Ensure proper focus management when composing complex UI.
